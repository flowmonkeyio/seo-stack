# Communications Plugin

The communications plugin is the StackOS package for provider-neutral
communication state plus Telegram bot messaging, local chat interactions, SMTP
email send, IMAP mailbox/message lifecycle, and communication-driven agent
requests.

The plugin is implemented in slices. Generic agent request operations are
executable in core StackOS. Telegram bot identity checks, text sends, photo
sends, callback answers, bounded diagnostic `updates.poll`, and webhook
set/delete/info are executable through the generic action registry. Telegram
secret-token ingress resolves project-scoped bot profiles, stores
callback/message events as resources, and creates generic agent requests only
when trigger/access policy allows it. Slack bot identity, message send,
conversation discovery, membership sync, and signed HTTP Events
API/Interactivity ingress are executable through the same action/resource
model. SMTP send and IMAP mailbox/message lifecycle actions are executable
through daemon-side credentials and mocked contract tests. Generic communication
profile/surface/membership/target/context operations are executable setup/read
operations; they do not call providers or models.

## Providers

- `local-agent-chat`: local StackOS conversation surface for direct human-to-agent
  messages, rich response blocks, and button/image/file interactions.
- `telegram-bot`: bot token auth for identity checks, text/photo sends, inline
  button callback answers, local-webhook setup through Telegram Bot API, and
  bounded diagnostics.
- `slack-bot`: bot token and signing-secret auth for identity checks, text or
  Block Kit sends, conversation discovery, membership sync, and signed HTTP
  Events API/Interactivity ingress. Socket Mode is deferred.
- `smtp`: password/app-password SMTP send. SMTP acceptance is not delivery or
  read confirmation.
- `imap`: password/app-password mailbox listing, search, fetch, and `Seen` flag
  lifecycle using UIDs.

## Resources

- `communication-profile`
- `communication-contact`
- `communication-target`
- `communication-route`
- `communication-membership`
- `communication-bot-profile`
- `communication-channel`
- `communication-thread`
- `communication-message`
- `communication-interaction`
- `communication-event`
- `communication-cursor`
- `agent-request-source`

The generic `agent_requests` queue belongs to core StackOS, not this plugin.
Its `agentRequest.*` operations are executable through REST, CLI, and MCP.
Communications can feed it only through trusted daemon ingestion or a run-plan
step that explicitly grants `agentRequest.create`.
`agentRequest.prepareRunPlan` is the generic handoff from an inbound request to
a caller-supplied run plan; it claims, creates, links, and returns the claim
token without choosing strategy or executing tools.

Telegram bot profiles are project scoped. Each profile binds to one credential
profile through `auth_profile_key`; there are no global Telegram credentials or
agent-visible bot tokens. Credentials store token material, webhook secrets, and
safe transport endpoints only; bot profiles store identity, agent guidance,
structured command intents, access policy, trigger policy, context policy,
response policy, and ingress mode. Visibility is
not activation: allowed group messages may be stored as bounded context without
creating an agent request. `local-webhook` is the normal local listener path;
`updates.poll` is diagnostic/bootstrap-only.

Slack communication profiles are project scoped. Each profile binds to a
project-scoped `slack-bot` credential profile through
`provider_facets.slack-bot.auth_profile_key`. Credentials store Slack token
material and the signing secret only; communication profiles store identity,
agent guidance, access policy, trigger policy, context policy, response policy,
and send/handoff policy. HTTP ingress verifies Slack signatures before storing
events or creating agent requests. `response_url` and `trigger_id` are transient
sensitive values and are not persisted.

SMTP and IMAP are project-scoped typed auth profiles. Agents see safe status and
opaque credential refs; host, username, password, TLS mode, and mailbox mapping
resolve only inside the daemon. SMTP acceptance is recorded as outbound message
submission metadata, not delivery or read state. IMAP uses UID/UIDVALIDITY-based
resources for mailbox cursor, message fetch, and local read/unread lifecycle.

Built-in templates cover inbox review, rich Telegram replies, callback
follow-up, and outbound notifications. They provide context/action structure for
agents; concrete action payloads still belong in run plans.

Project setup uses shared StackOS operations:

- `localAgentChat.createMessage` stores local human/agent chat messages as
  communication resources and can create a generic agent request for inbound
  messages. It does not run a model or decide workflow intent.
- `communicationProfile.*` stores provider-neutral identity, guidance, facets,
  and static policy.
- `communicationSurface.*` stores safe channel/DM/mailbox/local-chat surface
  metadata on the `communication-channel` resource.
- `communicationContact.*` stores safe cross-provider person, customer, team,
  bot, or organization refs.
- `communicationMembership.*` stores provider-neutral membership, permission,
  role, and scope state.
- `communicationTarget.*` stores and resolves named send destinations to
  explicit provider action refs. It does not send messages.
- `communicationRoute.*` stores static cross-surface handoff policy. It does
  not send messages or choose workflow behavior.
- `communicationContext.query` returns bounded stored communication-message
  history. It never fetches live provider history.
- `communicationBotProfile.upsert` creates or updates safe bot identity,
  guidance, and policy after the typed `telegram-bot` credential profile exists.
- `communicationBotProfile.get` and `communicationBotProfile.list` let agents
  inspect profiles without receiving token material.
- REST, CLI `ops call`, MCP, and the local Connections UI all use the same
  operation registry path for this setup.

## Architecture Boundary

Communications is an input/output and trigger layer. Agents decide what a
message or button click means, create run plans, select actions, and write
replies. StackOS stores provider state, resolves credentials daemon-side,
validates explicit payloads, executes configured calls, and records audit.

Telegram inline buttons use opaque `callback_data` only. Store the meaningful
state in `communication-interaction` resources keyed by bot profile, provider
message ref, and callback token, then let the agent read that resource before
deciding whether to respond, create a run plan, or ignore the event. Replies
that are bound to inbound work should carry
`source_agent_request_id` so response policy can enforce the originating bot
profile, chat, thread, and source message.
