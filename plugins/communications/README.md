# Communications Plugin

The communications plugin is the StackOS package for Telegram bot messaging,
rich chat interactions, SMTP email send, IMAP mailbox status, and
communication-driven agent requests.

The plugin is implemented in slices. Generic agent request operations are
executable in core StackOS. Telegram bot identity checks, text sends, photo
sends, callback answers, bounded diagnostic `updates.poll`, and webhook
set/delete/info are executable through the generic action registry. Telegram
secret-token ingress resolves project-scoped bot profiles, stores
callback/message events as resources, and creates generic agent requests only
when trigger/access policy allows it. SMTP and IMAP remain planned until their
connectors and mocked contract tests land.

## Providers

- `local-agent-chat`: local StackOS conversation surface for direct human-to-agent
  messages, rich response blocks, and button/image/file interactions.
- `telegram-bot`: bot token auth for identity checks, text/photo sends, inline
  button callback answers, local-webhook setup through Telegram Bot API, and
  bounded diagnostics.
- `smtp`: password/app-password SMTP send. SMTP acceptance is not delivery or
  read confirmation.
- `imap`: password/app-password mailbox listing, search, fetch, and `Seen` flag
  lifecycle using UIDs.

## Resources

- `communication-bot-profile`
- `communication-channel`
- `communication-thread`
- `communication-message`
- `communication-interaction`
- `communication-event`
- `communication-cursor`
- `agent-request-source`

The generic `agent_requests` queue belongs to core StackOS, not this plugin.
Its `agentRequest.*` operations are executable through REST, CLI, and MCP.
Communications can feed it only through trusted daemon ingestion or a run-plan
step that explicitly grants `agentRequest.create`.

Telegram bot profiles are project scoped. Each profile binds to one credential
profile through `auth_profile_key`; there are no global Telegram credentials or
agent-visible bot tokens. Credentials store token material, webhook secrets, and
safe transport endpoints only; bot profiles store persona, access policy,
trigger policy, context policy, response policy, and ingress mode. Visibility is
not activation: allowed group messages may be stored as bounded context without
creating an agent request. `local-webhook` is the normal local listener path;
`updates.poll` is diagnostic/bootstrap-only.

## Architecture Boundary

Communications is an input/output and trigger layer. Agents decide what a
message or button click means, create run plans, select actions, and write
replies. StackOS stores provider state, resolves credentials daemon-side,
validates explicit payloads, executes configured calls, and records audit.

Telegram inline buttons use opaque `callback_data` only. Store the meaningful
state in `communication-interaction` resources keyed by bot profile, provider
message ref, and callback token, then let the agent read that resource before
deciding whether to respond, create a run plan, or ignore the event. Replies
that are bound to inbound work should carry
`source_agent_request_id` so response policy can enforce the originating bot
profile, chat, thread, and source message.
