# content-stack Plugin

This is the plugin-first distribution surface for content-stack. The plugin is
intended to be installed once into Codex and/or Claude Code, then used from any
website repository.

The plugin starts a thin MCP bridge (`python -m content_stack mcp-bridge` in
the hydrated install) that connects to the singleton local content-stack daemon.
The bridge is disposable; the
daemon owns the SQLite database, project bindings, credentials, procedures,
articles, publish targets, and audit trails.

Website repositories should not need content-stack setup files. Repo-specific
knowledge is discovered from the current working directory and persisted in the
daemon through `workspace.*` tools.

Installers hydrate the personal Codex plugin location
`~/.codex/plugins/content-stack` and register it through
`~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` with source path
`./.codex/plugins/content-stack`. Restart Codex after install or upgrade, then
use `/plugins` to inspect or toggle the plugin.

The installed `.mcp.json` is rewritten during install to use the current Python
environment (`python -m content_stack mcp-bridge`), so clone-mode development
does not require a global `content-stack` executable on `PATH`.
If the daemon is not listening yet, the bridge auto-starts it on the configured
loopback host and writes startup output to
`~/.local/state/content-stack/mcp-bridge-autostart.log`.

## Agent-Facing MCP Surface

The daemon keeps the full internal MCP catalog for the UI, tests, and advanced
automation, but the plugin bridge exposes a small agent console:

- Direct tools: workspace binding/session tools, project list/create/get/update
  and active-project selection, `meta.enums`, `procedure.*`, and a few `run.*`
  status/control calls.
- Hidden setup helpers: credentials, voice, publish target, compliance, EEAT,
  schedule, and sitemap tools are available through `toolbox.describe` and
  `toolbox.call`.
- Step tools: when `procedure.currentStep` or `procedure.claimStep` returns a
  step package, the bridge reads `current_step.allowed_tools`; those tools
  become callable through `toolbox.call` for that run.

Agents should use direct tools for setup and procedure control, then use
`toolbox.describe` before calling any hidden tool. This keeps the model context
small without removing the daemon's richer capabilities.

The installed plugin is hydrated with the full content-stack skill catalog under
`skills/catalog/` and the procedure catalog under `procedures/`, so runtime
clients load content-stack through one plugin rather than loose per-project
files.
