"""Per audit P-G4: the wheel must bundle skills + procedures.

A pipx-mode install has no checked-out repo on disk, so
`content-stack install` resolves assets via `importlib.resources` from
``content_stack/_assets/skills/`` and ``content_stack/_assets/procedures/``.
We verify the wheel produced by `python -m build` contains those paths
with the same skill / procedure counts as the source repo.
