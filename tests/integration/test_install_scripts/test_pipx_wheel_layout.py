"""Per audit P-G4: the wheel must bundle skills and plugins.

A pipx-mode install has no checked-out repo on disk, so
`stackos install` resolves assets via `importlib.resources` from
``stackos/_assets/skills/`` and ``stackos/_assets/plugins/``.
We verify the wheel produced by `python -m build` contains those paths
with the same skill counts as the canonical StackOS skill source.
