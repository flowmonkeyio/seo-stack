# Connector Quality Gate

Audit date: 2026-05-22

Every registered action connector is held to the same review dimensions before
it can be treated as production-ready. Equal depth does not mean every provider
has the same features; it means every connector explicitly documents the same
questions: validation, safe error handling, pagination or async status,
rate-limit/budget behavior, provider documentation, auth shape, audit coverage,
and remaining gaps.

Agents are the primary users of these contracts. The agent chooses strategy,
creates run plans, and passes explicit action inputs. StackOS connectors only
validate the input, resolve daemon-held credentials, call the provider operation,
return safe structured output, and write audit records.

## Minimum Standard

- **Validation**: action schema plus connector validation reject malformed
  payloads, unsafe generic goals, and secret-looking input.
- **Errors**: provider failures are normalized into safe responses and action
  call audit records without leaking authorization headers, tokens, passwords,
  or raw credential payloads.
- **Pagination/status**: list, report, crawl, async, and batch operations expose
  bounded cursors/status outputs or are documented as submit-only/deferred.
- **Rate limits/budget**: retries, backoff, provider units, credits, quota, or
  explicit non-budget semantics are visible in metadata and docs.
- **Provider docs**: official docs for auth, operation shape, pagination,
  errors, and rate limits are linked from the contract ledger.
- **Audit**: executable actions have mocked or local tests that prove grant
  enforcement, credential resolution, redaction, and action-call persistence.

## Registered Connector Matrix

| Connector | Executable action surface | Contract docs | Validation | Errors | Pagination/status | Rate limits/budget | Current signoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ahrefs` | `seo.competitor.keywords`, `seo.backlink.research` | [`current-connectors.md`](current-connectors.md) | Provider-specific target/mode/input validation; enums still need tightening before expansion. | Safe action-call failures; API-unit headers still need capture. | First-page/list calls only; future backlinks/keyword pagination must be explicit. | Budget enforcement disabled until API-unit accounting is mapped. | Executable, narrow, with tracked gaps. |
| `apollo` | People/org search and enrichment actions | [`gtm-prospecting-outbound.md`](gtm-prospecting-outbound.md) | Search/enrichment schemas bound to Apollo endpoint concepts; broad provider bags still need metadata tightening. | Connector must normalize 401/403/422/429 and credit failures. | Page/per_page contract required; stop before provider caps. | Credit-consuming endpoints require credit budget metadata. | Executable first pass; needs pagination/rate-limit tests before expansion. |
| `clay` | `gtm.clay.table.webhook.submit` | [`gtm-prospecting-outbound.md`](gtm-prospecting-outbound.md) | Static table webhook payload validation; no generic Clay API action. | Webhook delivery errors must be normalized and redacted. | Async workflow result ingestion is separate/deferred. | Project-specific table/workflow throttles must be documented per connection. | Executable webhook submit only; enterprise API deferred. |
| `dataforseo` | Keyword volume, SERP, PAA | [`current-connectors.md`](current-connectors.md) | Keyword/depth caps validated against exposed action schemas. | Provider task errors and cost rows are normalized. | Current live endpoints are bounded; Labs pagination needs explicit actions before exposure. | `tasks[].cost` reconciles post-call cost; QPS honors documented limits. | Executable, narrow, with Labs gaps tracked. |
| `firecrawl` | Scrape, crawl submit, map | [`current-connectors.md`](current-connectors.md) | URL and option validation exists; format object support is intentionally not exposed yet. | Base integration retries/normalizes provider errors. | Crawl is submit-only until a crawl-status/pagination action exists. | Budget estimates exist for exposed calls; rate limiting uses the shared base. | Executable; crawl-status action required before templates consume crawl results. |
| `ghost` | Admin post create | [`current-connectors.md`](current-connectors.md) | Post payload and API version are scoped to create-post HTML source. | JWT/auth/post errors are normalized and redacted. | No list/update/image pagination actions exposed. | No monetary budget; provider throttling remains provider-error metadata. | Executable create-post only. |
| `google-ads` | Customer, budget, campaign, ad group, asset, ad, report, conversion actions | [`media-buying.md`](media-buying.md) | Provider-native schemas for first action set; more enums/mutate constraints still need tightening. | Google Ads error details must stay sanitized and include request ids where present. | Reporting/search pagination and mutate partial failures need explicit tests. | Quotas and conversion/mutate costs are documented but need richer metadata. | Executable first pass; high priority for deeper mocked provider tests. |

| `mock-provider` | `utils.mock.echo` | [`../integration-testing.md`](../integration-testing.md) | Local scenarios cover success, partial success, provider errors, auth errors, rate limits, and timeout. | Redaction/audit failure path is tested without live credentials. | Not paginated; scenarios prove status handling. | Local cost_cents input proves budget/audit plumbing without vendor accounts. | Local proof connector for REST, CLI, and MCP. |
| `openai-images` | Image generation | [`current-connectors.md`](current-connectors.md) | GPT Image model/size/quality/formats validated against supported profiles. | API errors are normalized; raw base64 is stripped from persisted output. | Not paginated. | Model/size/quality estimates are encoded; pricing requires scheduled doc audit. | Executable with cost estimates. |
