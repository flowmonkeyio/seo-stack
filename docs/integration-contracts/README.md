# Integration Contracts

This directory is the source of truth for provider contract reviews before a
StackOS action becomes executable.

StackOS provider work has three states:

- `deferred`: provider/action/resource/template metadata exists, but the action
  is intentionally not executable yet. The action config must include
  `execution_mode` and a `deferred_reason`.
- `executable`: provider action has static connector config, daemon-side auth
  resolution, validation, redaction, audit, tests, and approval/grant coverage.
- `project-local`: the built-in catalog declares a project-owned integration
  point, but execution requires that project to install static connector config.

## Contract Reviews

| Review | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Current Connectors](current-connectors.md) | OpenAI Images, Firecrawl, Jina, Reddit, DataForSEO, Ahrefs, WordPress, Ghost, sitemap, HTTP | Executable surface audited; follow-up corrections required. |
| [GTM CRM](gtm-crm.md) | HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive CRM and pipeline contracts | First executable connector pass delivered; keep schemas provider-native. |
| [GTM Prospecting And Outbound](gtm-prospecting-outbound.md) | Apollo, Clay, Clearbit/Clearbit by HubSpot, Outreach, Salesloft, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365 | First executable connector pass delivered except explicit deferred actions. |
| [Media Buying](media-buying.md) | Meta Marketing API, Google Ads API, Outbrain, Taboola, custom media tool contracts | Meta, Google Ads, and Taboola first pass executable; Outbrain and custom media tool actions deferred until provider docs or project-local HTTP connector config exist. |

## Current Integration Status

| Domain | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `core` | Generic project memory, context, learnings, experiments, decisions, and local daemon primitives are the stable foundation. |
| `utils` | OpenAI Images, Firecrawl scrape/crawl/map, Jina Reader, Reddit, sitemap, and static HTTP connector paths are executable through `action.execute`; async extract/status-depth remains deferred until status and artifact contracts exist. |
| `seo` | DataForSEO keyword/SERP/PAA and Ahrefs competitor/backlink actions are executable. GSC, GA4, crawl imports, and broader DataForSEO/Ahrefs breadth still require explicit action contracts. |
| `publishing` | WordPress and Ghost post-create actions are executable. Media upload, update, scheduling, taxonomy, and richer CMS operations still need contracts. |
| `media-buying` | Meta Ads, Google Ads, and Taboola first actions are executable. Outbrain and custom media tools remain deferred or project-local until provider/project contracts are supplied. |
| `gtm` | First CRM, enrichment, outbound, and workspace actions are executable where provider contracts are documented. Clearbit/inbound/custom project-local actions remain explicit deferred modes. |

Provider-specific direct MCP tools are not part of the current architecture.
Provider calls should enter through plugin action manifests, daemon connectors,
run-plan grants, and `action.execute`.

## Delivery Gate

Before adding or changing `config.connector` on any action:

1. Link official provider docs in the relevant contract review.
2. Use provider-specific action refs and schemas.
3. Define safe auth method fields and daemon-only credential handling.
4. Add connector code with doc links near provider-specific calls.
5. Add validation, redaction, audit, rate-limit/error, pagination, and budget
   tests as appropriate.
6. Prove MCP/REST/UI availability reports the right setup state.
7. Run a stale-ref scan across manifests, workflow templates, tests, and docs.
8. Confirm every workflow action contract exists in the owning plugin manifest.

If any item is missing, use an explicit deferred execution mode rather than an
empty or misleading connector config.

## Integration Completion Rule

An integration is complete only when it has a provider manifest, typed auth
setup or explicit no-auth state, daemon-only credential resolution, executable
actions with meaningful schemas, decision-free connector code, run-plan grant
coverage, redacted action-call audit, generic UI visibility, tests, and docs
for setup and limitations.
