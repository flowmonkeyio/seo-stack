# StackOS Action Executor

The action executor is the daemon-side foundation for provider and utility
calls. It is intentionally a substrate, not an agent decision layer.

Agents and humans still decide what to do. StackOS only describes action
contracts, validates explicit payloads, resolves daemon-held credentials, calls
registered connector adapters, redacts output, records audit, and enforces
mechanical limits such as idempotency and optional budget pre-emption.

## Action Manifest

Action catalog rows come from plugin manifests. The executable fields live in
`actions.config_json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "stackos.action.v1",
  "connector": "openai-images",
  "operation": "image.generate",
  "requires_credential": true,
  "allows_credential": true,
  "budget_kind": "openai-images",
  "enforce_budget": true
}
```

The manifest is static configuration. It must not contain API keys, bearer
tokens, OAuth tokens, passwords, refresh tokens, or provider-specific strategy.
Raw secrets are rejected during manifest parsing.

Credential refs are rejected unless the action manifest explicitly allows
credential use. For most authenticated providers, `requires_credential` implies
`allows_credential`; no-auth/local actions do not receive credentials by
accident.

## Connector Boundary

Connectors implement the tiny adapter contract in
`stackos/actions/connectors.py`:

- `validate(request)`: payload checks without provider side effects.
- `estimate_cost_cents(request)`: mechanical cost estimate.
- `execute(request)`: provider/tool call with an already-resolved credential.

Connectors receive plaintext secrets only inside the daemon process through
`ResolvedCredential`. That object is not a Pydantic response model and must not
be serialized into MCP, REST, run plans, resources, artifacts, or audit rows.

## Audit

Every internal execution writes an `action_calls` sidecar row with:

- project/run/run-plan linkage when available
- plugin/action/provider/connector identity
- opaque `credential_ref` and internal credential id
- redacted request/response/metadata
- status, dry-run flag, duration, cost, error, and idempotency key

`action.execute` returns the public action-call audit shape for workflow runs.
`action.run` returns a compact direct-action result by default and includes the
full redacted action call only when `verbose=true`. Internal database
identifiers such as `credential_id`, `action_id`, and replay-only
`idempotency_key` stay in storage and are not returned to agents. For write
actions, callers may pass `idempotency_key` or the more agent-friendly
`intent_id`; when neither is supplied, direct calls derive a request-scoped key
and workflow calls derive a stable run/step/action key before reaching the
connector.

The read API exposes the same public audit shape at
`GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/action-calls`. It can be filtered by run,
run plan, run-plan step, plugin, action key, and status. The StackOS UI exposes
this as the project-level **Action Calls** ledger, while run detail continues to
show the calls scoped to a specific run/step.

The table is part of the clean StackOS core. Domain plugins store their durable
objects in resources/artifacts; removed workflow-specific storage is not part
of the current execution model.

## Availability

Visible catalog action rows and `action.describe` now include a generic
`availability` object. It is a setup signal, not a workflow decision:

- `status`: `ready`, `unknown`, `deferred`, `project_local_required`,
  `not_executable`, `missing_connector`, `missing_credential`,
  `credential_failed`, `missing_budget`, `budget_blocked`, `plugin_disabled`,
  or `provider_disabled`
- `executable`: whether the current project setup can run the action
- connector, operation, credential, and budget state
- safe opaque credential refs when connected
- machine-readable reasons such as `credential_required` or `budget_required`

Agents may use this to know what setup is missing, but they still pass exact
payloads and action refs. StackOS does not infer which action should run.
`plugin_disabled` and `provider_disabled` are also enforced by `action.run` and
`action.execute` because they are static setup policy, not agent strategy.

## Operation Surface

Action calls are now registered once as StackOS operations, then exposed through
MCP, the generic REST operation endpoint, and the CLI when the operation surface
allows it. Agents and scripts can inspect the operation contract with:

```bash
stackos ops describe action.execute --json
stackos ops describe action.run --json
```

or through `GET /api/v1/operations/action.execute` and
`GET /api/v1/operations/action.run`.

Direct/read discovery operations:

- `action.describe`
- `action.validate`
- `toolProfile.resolve` when an agent needs a safe provider/profile/credential
  tuple before choosing an explicit action payload

Run-plan-scoped execution operation:

- `action.execute`

Direct one-action execution operation:

- `action.run`

`action.run` is direct execution for one explicit action. Non-read actions
require `confirm_direct=true` and `intent_summary`; callers may pass
`intent_id` or `idempotency_key` for stable retries. The result is compact
unless the caller passes `verbose=true`. It is not a substitute for workflow
memory, approval gates, artifacts, learnings, experiments, or decisions.

`action.execute` is not direct execution surface. It is callable only through a
started run plan, exactly one active claimed step, an explicit
`mcp_tool_grants` entry with `tool: "action.execute"`, and matching
`action_refs`. The active step must also declare the same action ref in
`action_refs`, so both the workflow step contract and the frozen grant snapshot
must agree before the connector is invoked.

Registered first-party connectors are one provider per connector file and now
cover the migrated clean path for:

- `openai-images`: `utils.image.generate`
- `firecrawl`: `utils.web.scrape`, `utils.web.crawl`, `utils.web.map`
- `jina`: `utils.web.read` with optional credentials
- `sitemap`: `utils.sitemap.fetch`
- `reddit`: `utils.reddit.search-subreddit`, `utils.reddit.top-questions`
- `dataforseo`: `seo.keyword.research`, `seo.serp.analyze`, `seo.paa.extract`
- `ahrefs`: `seo.competitor.keywords`, `seo.backlink.research`
- `wordpress`: `publishing.wordpress.post.create`
- `ghost`: `publishing.ghost.post.create`
- `http`: static custom HTTP/Webhook actions declared by installed plugins
- `telegram-bot`: project-scoped Telegram bot identity, message/photo sends,
  callback answers, diagnostic update inspection, and webhook set/delete/info
- `slack-bot`: project-scoped Slack bot identity, message sends, conversation
  open/info/list/member discovery, and signed HTTP ingress resource flow
- `smtp`: `communications.smtp.email.send` with daemon-side password auth and
  accepted/rejected recipient metadata only
- `imap`: mailbox list, bounded UID search, selected message fetch, and mark
  seen/unseen lifecycle actions
- `hubspot`, `salesforce`, `apollo`, `pipedrive`, `clay`, `outreach`,
  `salesloft`, `google-workspace`, and `microsoft-365`: first GTM/RevOps
  provider actions
- `meta-ads`, `google-ads`, and `taboola`: first paid media provider actions

Actions that are intentionally not executable use explicit `execution_mode`
metadata, such as `deferred-partner-api`, `deferred-inbound`,
`deferred-firecrawl-async-extract`, or `project-local-http`. `utils.web.extract`
is intentionally deferred until StackOS has an explicit Firecrawl status-poll
action and output artifact contract. Catalog availability reports those modes
directly instead of treating them as missing connectors. Outbrain and user-owned
webhook actions remain deferred until endpoint-level contracts or project-local
static HTTP config are supplied.

The OpenAI Images connector persists base64 image bytes under generated assets
and returns local artifact URLs with no `b64_json` payload. Other connectors
normalize wrapper results into action output JSON and record the provider,
operation, cost, status, and redacted payloads in `action_calls`.

Communication setup is not an action connector. Telegram bot profile setup uses
the shared `communicationBotProfile.upsert/get/list` operations across REST,
CLI, and MCP after the project-scoped `telegram-bot` credential exists. Slack
uses project-scoped `communication-profile` records with a
`provider_facets.slack-bot.auth_profile_key` binding after the project-scoped
`slack-bot` credential exists. Agents execute Telegram or Slack provider calls
through `action.run` for one explicit message/diagnostic call, or through
`action.execute` once a run-plan step grants the relevant action ref. SMTP and
IMAP credentials are also project-scoped auth profiles; agents receive only
opaque credential refs and safe status, while the connector resolves
host/user/password/TLS config inside the daemon process.

The generic HTTP connector is a plugin-authoring escape hatch, not a direct
agent browsing tool. The endpoint, method, auth mode, request mode, static
headers, timeout, and response mode live in action `config_json.http`; the
agent only supplies the action input payload allowed by that plugin action's
schema.

## Boundary

Actions are dumb execution units. They do not pick campaigns, choose variants,
optimize budgets, interpret SEO opportunities, or decide next steps. Those
decisions belong to the agent/person and are passed into StackOS as explicit
payloads, run plans, resources, learnings, decisions, or approvals.
