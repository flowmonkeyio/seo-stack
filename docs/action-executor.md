# StackOS Action Executor

D08 adds the internal action execution foundation. It is intentionally a daemon
substrate, not an agent decision layer.

Agents and humans still decide what to do. StackOS only describes action
contracts, validates explicit payloads, resolves daemon-held credentials, calls
registered connector adapters, redacts output, records audit, and enforces
mechanical limits such as idempotency and optional budget pre-emption.

## Action Manifest

Action catalog rows come from plugin manifests. The executable fields live in
`actions.config_json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "stackos.action.v1",
  "connector": "openai-images",
  "operation": "image.generate",
  "requires_credential": true,
  "allows_credential": true,
  "budget_kind": "openai-images",
  "enforce_budget": true
}
```

The manifest is static configuration. It must not contain API keys, bearer
tokens, OAuth tokens, passwords, refresh tokens, or provider-specific strategy.
Raw secrets are rejected during manifest parsing.

Credential refs are rejected unless the action manifest explicitly allows
credential use. For most authenticated providers, `requires_credential` implies
`allows_credential`; no-auth/local actions do not receive credentials by
accident.

## Connector Boundary

Connectors implement the tiny adapter contract in
`content_stack/actions/connectors.py`:

- `validate(request)`: payload checks without provider side effects.
- `estimate_cost_cents(request)`: mechanical cost estimate.
- `execute(request)`: provider/tool call with an already-resolved credential.

Connectors receive plaintext secrets only inside the daemon process through
`ResolvedCredential`. That object is not a Pydantic response model and must not
be serialized into MCP, REST, run plans, resources, artifacts, or audit rows.

## Audit

Every internal execution writes an `action_calls` sidecar row with:

- project/run/run-plan linkage when available
- plugin/action/provider/connector identity
- opaque `credential_ref` and internal credential id
- redacted request/response/metadata
- status, dry-run flag, duration, cost, error, and idempotency key

The table is additive. D08 does not drop or rewrite legacy SEO, procedure, or
vendor-operation tables.

## MCP Surface

D08 exposes only read/discovery tools:

- `action.describe`
- `action.validate`

`action.execute` is not registered as an MCP tool after D09. The run-plan grant
model is now in place for generic mutations, but generic action execution
remains internal until D10 exposes the first safe real action through the same
step-scoped path.

## Boundary

Actions are dumb execution units. They do not pick campaigns, choose variants,
optimize budgets, interpret SEO opportunities, or decide next steps. Those
decisions belong to the agent/person and are passed into StackOS as explicit
payloads, run plans, resources, learnings, decisions, or approvals.
