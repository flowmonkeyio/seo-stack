# Run Plans

A run plan is a concrete, auditable execution plan for one run. It is usually
derived from a workflow template, then authored by an agent for the project,
goal, context, and approval requirements at hand.

The mechanics are intentionally agent-first. Humans and scripts can bootstrap,
inspect, approve, and administer through UI, CLI, or REST, but the normal
execution user is an agent creating a precise run plan, claiming steps, calling
granted actions, and recording results.

## Lifecycle

1. Use the bootstrap/setup MCP surface to choose or create the project and set
   non-secret configuration such as schedules and budgets.
2. Discover or describe a template with `workflowTemplate.*`.
3. Create a concrete plan with `runPlan.create`.
4. Validate it with `runPlan.validate`.
5. Start it with `runPlan.start` and keep the returned `run_token`.
6. Claim and record steps through run-plan controller tools using that
   `run_token`.
7. Inspect execution through `runPlan.get`, `run.get`, and `run.list`.

`runPlan.create` also mirrors the plan into the project task tracker: one task
for the run plan and one ticket per concrete step. Agents can use
`tracker.next`, `tracker.brief`, and `tracker.verify` to navigate work without
scanning the full run-plan payload every time.

## Grants

Run-plan grants are frozen in `run_plans.grant_snapshot_json`.

The daemon dispatcher requires:

- the `run_token` returned by `runPlan.start`
- a started plan
- exactly one running step
- matching `project_id`
- an explicit grant for the requested tool/action/resource/context fields

Direct context reads use the safe field set. Advanced context fields,
resource/artifact mutations, memory writes, workflow-scoped communication sends,
and `action.execute` require step-scoped grants.

For `action.execute`, the active step must declare the target action ref and
the matching `mcp_tool_grants` entry must include that exact ref in
`action_refs`. A step that declares `utils.image.generate` cannot execute a
different action, and a grant snapshot that names a different action cannot be
used to satisfy the step.

For `communication.send`, the matching `mcp_tool_grants` entry must include
`targets` such as `communication-target:ops-alerts`. This keeps workflow
notifications and handoffs explicit while still allowing simple non-workflow
messages through the direct `communication.send` path.

For `communication.reply`, the matching `mcp_tool_grants` entry must include
`sources` such as `telegram-bot`, `slack-bot`, or a specific stored source
surface. The daemon checks the request origin before allowing the reply.

The run plan is not used for StackOS bootstrap itself. Creating a project,
selecting it, setting non-secret budget/schedule configuration, and creating or
starting the run plan are direct setup operations. Once execution begins, the
run-plan grant snapshot is the boundary for workflow writes and tool execution.

## Audit

Runs store top-level execution state. Run steps and tool calls store the
fine-grained audit trail for agent activity and daemon-side execution.

Use `run.insertStep`, `run.recordStepCall`, `run.listSteps`, and
`run.listStepCalls` for audit grain outside the run-plan controller path.

Use [`task-tracker.md`](./task-tracker.md) for project work state. The tracker
is not the grant boundary; it is the navigation and lifecycle mirror for tasks,
tickets, dependencies, and verification.

## UI

The Runs UI renders generic run and run-plan state. The Tasks UI renders the
project tracker with workflow filters, status filters, dependency graph, and
ticket detail navigation. Workflow-specific views should be plugin/resource
renderers unless a signed-off task scopes a bespoke page.
