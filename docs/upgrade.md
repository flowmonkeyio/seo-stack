# Upgrading content-stack

Per audit P-G2, both install paths upgrade through a single command.
Re-running the install pipeline is **idempotent** (audit B-24): the
end state after one run matches the end state after ten.

## pipx mode

Once published to PyPI:

```bash
pipx upgrade content-stack
content-stack install
```

`pipx upgrade` swaps the wheel; `content-stack install` then re-mirrors
skills + procedures from the wheel's bundled `_assets/` tree, refreshes
MCP registrations, and runs `doctor`.

## Clone mode

```bash
git pull
make install
```

`make install` re-syncs Python deps, runs migrations to head, rebuilds
the UI bundle (no-op once committed), and re-runs every install script
(skills, procedures, MCP, doctor).

## What happens during upgrade

| Step | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Schema | `alembic upgrade head` runs at every daemon start. Down-migrations exist but are discouraged. |
| Skills + procedures | `rsync -a --delete` mirrors source -> target. **Retired skills / procedures disappear** on the next install. |
| MCP registration | Codex CLI: `codex mcp add` is a no-op when already registered (the script greps `mcp list` first). Claude Code: atomic JSON merge with `.bak` backup; sibling servers preserved. |
| Auth token | **Does not rotate on upgrade.** Run `content-stack rotate-token --yes` or `make rotate-token` explicitly to rotate; registration refreshes saved configs. Restart any running daemon so middleware loads the new token. |
| launchd plist | If the existing plist matches the generated one, it's a no-op. If different, `--force` overwrites with a `.bak` retained. |

## Breaking changes

Bump major version. Release notes call out manual migrations:

- DB schema changes: covered by Alembic — no action required.
- Skill / procedure removals: documented in the changelog; the install
  step deletes them automatically via `rsync --delete`.
- Auth token format change: would require an explicit `rotate-token`
  call; surfaced in release notes if it ever happens.
- `content-stack` CLI subcommand removal: blocked by a deprecation
  cycle (warn for one minor, then remove on the next major).

## Rollback

```bash
# Roll back to a previous commit (clone mode)
git checkout <previous-tag>
make install

# Roll back to a previous wheel (pipx mode)
pipx install --force "content-stack==<previous-version>"
content-stack install
```

A backup of the SQLite DB lives at
`~/.local/share/content-stack/backups/` (auto-backup job, weekly,
12-week retention) — `make restore <file>` halts the daemon, copies
the backup over the live DB, and restarts.

## Schema migrations

Migrations run automatically every time the daemon boots
(`alembic upgrade head` is invoked from the lifespan). Operators do
not normally need to run `make migrate` by hand. Down-migrations
exist (`alembic downgrade <rev>`) but are discouraged: they run
forward-only in CI, and a down-migration that drops columns may
shed data depending on the change.

Breaking schema changes bump the major version (1.x → 2.0). Release
notes call out manual operator steps.

## Cross-machine moves

Migration of an install across machines requires copying:

- `~/.local/share/content-stack/content-stack.db` (the canonical DB)
- `~/.local/state/content-stack/seed.bin` (encryption seed)
- `~/.local/state/content-stack/auth.token` (bearer token)

Without `seed.bin`, the daemon refuses to start and `doctor` emits a
warning to run `content-stack reset-integrations` (clears the
encrypted credentials and prompts for re-entry). The DB itself stays
intact — only `integration_credentials` rows become unrecoverable.
