"""Seed file lifecycle: ensure, load, rotate.

The seed is 32 bytes from ``os.urandom`` stored at
``~/.local/state/content-stack/seed.bin`` mode 0600. We mirror the
``auth.ensure_token`` pattern: TOCTOU-safe ``O_EXCL`` create, refuse to
load if the file exists with the wrong mode (PLAN.md L1110-L1113).

Rotation (``content-stack rotate-seed --reencrypt``) first re-encrypts
rows in memory, stages the new seed at ``seed.bin.new``, lets the CLI
commit the DB rows, then promotes the staged seed into place. The old
seed is kept as ``seed.bin.bak`` for one daemon boot — the next
``ensure_seed_file`` call deletes the backup so a stale seed can't sit
on disk indefinitely (PLAN.md L1140-L1142).
