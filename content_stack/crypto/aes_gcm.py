"""AES-256-GCM encrypt / decrypt with project-bound AAD (PLAN.md L1117-L1124).

Every row in ``integration_credentials`` is encrypted under the same
HKDF-derived key (PLAN.md L1114-L1116) but with a fresh per-row 12-byte
nonce and an AAD that binds the ciphertext to its row context::

    AAD = f"project_id={p}|kind={k}".encode()

where ``p`` is the integer ``project_id`` for project-scoped rows or the
literal string ``global`` for project-less rows. Tampering with either
column or moving a row between projects renders the ciphertext
undecryptable.

The wire format inside ``encrypted_payload`` is ``ciphertext || auth_tag``
— that's what ``cryptography``'s ``AESGCM.encrypt`` returns natively, so
we simply persist the byte string without further wrapping.
