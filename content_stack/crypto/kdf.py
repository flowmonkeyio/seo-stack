"""HKDF-SHA256 key derivation for AES-256-GCM (PLAN.md L1114-L1116).

The seed (32 random bytes from disk) is the IKM. We derive a single
32-byte AES-256 key with the constant info string
``b"content-stack:integration-credentials:v1"``. Per-row separation of
ciphertexts comes from the GCM nonce + AAD pair, not from per-row keys.

We expose only ``derive_key`` so callers cannot accidentally vary the
``info`` string and lose the ability to decrypt existing rows.
