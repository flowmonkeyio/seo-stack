"""Google People-Also-Ask scraper (PLAN.md L1053).

This is the no-key "integration" — there's no Google PAA API, so we
delegate to ``FirecrawlIntegration`` (the supported scraper) to fetch
the SERP page and extract the PAA box markup. Cost flows through
Firecrawl's budget; this wrapper exists so the skill code can call
``GooglePaaIntegration.extract(query=...)`` symmetrically with the
other integrations rather than hard-coding the Firecrawl detour.

The response shape is normalised to ``{"questions": [str, ...]}`` so
callers don't need to know about the Firecrawl markdown shape.
