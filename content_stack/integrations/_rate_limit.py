"""Token-bucket rate limiter for per-integration QPS caps (PLAN.md L1037-L1041).

Each integration declares a default qps (DataForSEO 5, Firecrawl 2, GSC
1, OpenAI Images 10, …); the ``IntegrationBudgets.qps`` column overrides
per project. The bucket capacity equals the qps so a brief burst of N
calls is allowed but sustained throughput is rate-limited.

The buckets are *process-level* — the daemon runs single-process so we
don't need cross-process coordination. Keys are
``(project_id_or_None, kind)`` so a "global" credential and a
project-scoped credential maintain independent buckets even when their
``kind`` matches.
