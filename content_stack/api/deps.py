"""FastAPI dependencies — session, settings, pagination, etag.

Centralised so every router pulls its plumbing from the same place. The
session is yielded per-request from the engine on ``app.state``; the
engine itself is built once during the lifespan startup hook and shared
across all requests (SQLAlchemy owns its connection pool internally).

Tests can override these dependencies via FastAPI's ``app.dependency_overrides``
hook; the M2 test fixtures do exactly that to swap in an in-memory engine
+ a per-test session.
