"""FastAPI routers — REST surface for the UI and external clients.

``register_routers`` mounts every M2 router onto a given FastAPI app
plus the M0 health router. Exception handlers + the request-id
middleware are wired here too so ``server.create_app`` stays a single
``register_routers(app)`` call.
