"""UI token bootstrap endpoint — ``GET /api/v1/auth/ui-token``.

The Vue UI ships in the same origin as the daemon, but JavaScript in the
browser cannot read the token file at ``~/.local/state/content-stack/auth.token``
directly (file system access is blocked). This endpoint is the bridge: the
SPA fetches its bearer token at boot via a same-origin GET and then attaches
``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` to every subsequent ``/api/v1/*`` request.

**Whitelist note (security trade-off; documented in docs/security.md):**

This endpoint is added to ``WHITELIST_PREFIXES`` in
``content_stack.auth`` so the unauthenticated browser can reach it. The
upstream defenders are:

1. ``HostHeaderMiddleware`` rejects any request whose ``Host:`` header is
   not loopback (``localhost``, ``127.0.0.1``, ``[::1]``) with 421 — so a
   cross-origin browser fetch with a forged Host header is blocked.
2. ``CORSMiddleware`` is configured ``same-origin`` only — a different
   site cannot read the response from JavaScript even if it triggered the
   request.
3. The daemon binds to ``127.0.0.1`` only (the CLI rejects ``--host
   0.0.0.0``), so off-machine callers can't reach the port at all.

The residual exposure is *another local process on the same machine* that
can connect to ``127.0.0.1:5180`` — those processes can fetch the token
just by GETting this endpoint. This is a regression from the file-mode-0600
posture in that narrow case, accepted as the cost of admitting a browser
client. Operators who want the older posture can run the UI in a separate
browser profile or paste the token by hand (a future hardening, out of
scope for M5).
