"""Health endpoint — `GET /api/v1/health`.

This is the only endpoint whitelisted from bearer-token auth; doctor uses
it to probe liveness *before* it has the token resolved.

Response shape (M0 subset; later milestones add `auth_token_mode_ok`,
`seed_file_ok`, and `integrations_reachable`):

    {
      "daemon_uptime_s": 12.3,
      "db_status": "ok" | "unreachable",
      "scheduler_running": false,
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "milestone": "M0"
    }

Latency target: < 50 ms p99. Implemented with a synchronous `SELECT 1` on
the engine — SQLite is in-process so this is cheap.
