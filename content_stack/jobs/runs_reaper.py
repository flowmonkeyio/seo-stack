"""Orphan-runs reaper job — M8.

Per audit BLOCKER-13 / PLAN.md L1366-L1391: every 5 minutes (and once
at daemon startup) we sweep ``runs`` for rows whose ``status='running'``
and ``heartbeat_at`` is older than 5 minutes. Reaped rows flip to
``aborted`` with ``error='daemon-restart-orphan'`` and any live child
runs cascade-abort.

The ``RunRepository.reap_stale`` method is the canonical implementation
(M1.B); this module is the *job wrapper* that APScheduler invokes.
Keeping the wrapper thin makes the job's effects easy to observe in
tests — the bulk of the logic lives in the repo where it's exercised
by the M1.B reap_stale tests too.
